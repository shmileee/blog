When collaborating on a codebase, ensuring that every contributor uses the same
versions of key tools can prevent countless headaches. Historically, `asdf`
([asdf-vm.com](https://asdf-vm.com)) helped unify tool versions by reading from
a single `.tool-versions` file. Now, `mise`
([mise.jdx.dev](https://mise.jdx.dev)) steps in as a faster, more robust
successor, providing a snappier experience and more powerful commands.

## What Is `mise`?

It is a tool written in Rust that manages and installs language runtimes and
binaries according to specifications listed in `.tool-versions`. Think of
`.tool-versions` as a top-level "meta" file that defines the versions of tools
(e.g., Terraform, Node.js) required by your project. Both `asdf` and `mise` can
read it, so you can maintain compatibility and ease the transition.

With `mise`, a single command can quickly install or update every tool your
project relies on, aligning local (and even CI) setups across contributors.

## Example Usage

1. [Install `mise` itself](https://mise.jdx.dev/installing-mise.html).

2. Add a `.tool-versions` file to specify your desired tools, for example:

   ```bash
   terraform 1.9.7
   ```

3. Run:

   ```bash
   $ mise install
   ```

   Thatâ€™s it. Your `terraform` is now set up. Verify:

   ```bash
   $ which terraform
   ~/.local/share/mise/installs/terraform/1.9.7/bin/terraform
   ```

4. ðŸ’¡ If you have a monorepo with multiple Terraform stacks, each may require
   slightly different version of `terraform` binary. For example, consider a
   stack with the following requirement:

   ```hcl
   terraform {
      required_version = "1.9.4"
   }
   ```

   To contextually set the proper version for this stack, you can simply `cd`
   into the directory and run:

   ```bash
   $ mise use terraform@1.9.4
   ```

   This sets `1.9.4` as the active version for that directory. Need a
   quick, one-off command without changing your environment permanently? Run:

   ```bash
   $ mise x terraform@1.9.4 -- terraform plan
   ```

   This executes `terraform plan` with the desired version on the fly, leaving
   no lingering changes to your setup.

## Considerations

While `mise` makes it easy to version tools, not every binary needs tight
version control. For instance:

- **`awscli`**: Since AWS CLI updates rarely introduce breaking changes,
  pinning its version offers limited value. With automated dependency updates,
  you donâ€™t want to waste time reviewing trivial pull requests from Renovate or
  Dependabot and making everyone rerun `mise install` just to stay on the latest
  minor release.
- **`python`**: Most OSes ship with a suitable version for light, general
  usage. If your project isnâ€™t Python-focused or doesnâ€™t depend on
  python-version-specific features, you might skip versioning Python here. If you
  _are_ doing heavy Python development involving multiple versions, you might
  want to consider a dedicated Python environment manager like
  [rye](https://github.com/astral-sh/rye).

## Summary

`mise` elevates the concept of a `.tool-versions` file into a lightning-fast,
more flexible tool version manager. It keeps your team aligned, reduces
environment drift, and supports easy overrides and ephemeral runs. Choose your
versioned tools wisely â€” versioning every last binary might not be practical.
But for those critical runtime dependencies that ensure consistency across
collaborators, `mise` is a powerful, streamlined solution.
